# Job Market Analytics: AI/ML vs General IT Trends
# Here is the final report https://daniel21b.github.io/Job-Market-Analytics/

A comprehensive analysis examining the evolution of job postings in the technology sector, comparing AI/Machine Learning roles against traditional General IT positions from October 2023 to October 2024.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes over 4,000 technology job postings to understand market trends, growth patterns, and company positioning in the AI hiring landscape. The analysis addresses the research question: **Is the job market for AI/ML roles growing faster than traditional IT roles?**

## Data Sources

- **Hacker News "Who is hiring?" threads** - Monthly job posting threads from October 2023 to October 2024
- **Adzuna Job Search API** - Technology-related job postings from 2023-2024

Total records analyzed: 4,137 technology job postings after data cleaning and processing.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
- Web scraping using BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
- API integration with pagination and checkpoint saves
- Date range: October 2023 - October 2024 (13 months)

### Data Cleaning
- Deduplication based on company, role, and location
- Date standardization to unified datetime format
- Missing value handling with strategic dropping
- Text preprocessing and company name standardization

### Job Categorization

Jobs are classified into four categories using a keyword-based scoring system:

- **AI/ML Roles:** Machine learning engineers, data scientists, AI researchers
- **General IT Roles:** Software engineers, DevOps, web developers, cloud engineers
- **Hybrid Roles:** MLOps engineers, AI platform engineers
- **Non-Tech Roles:** Healthcare, retail, administrative positions

Categorization uses 130+ keyword patterns across technologies, frameworks, and role titles.

### Statistical Analysis

- Linear regression for trend analysis
- Mann-Kendall test for monotonic trends
- Pearson correlation coefficients
- T-tests for comparing time periods
- Month-over-month growth rate calculations

## Key Findings

### Market Composition
- AI/ML roles represent a significant portion of the technology job market
- General IT roles continue to dominate overall tech hiring
- Hybrid roles emerging as distinct category bridging both domains

### Trends
- Both AI/ML and General IT show temporal variation over the analysis period
- Clear company stratification between AI-heavy and traditional IT approaches
- Market dynamics remain fluid with month-to-month variation

### Company Positioning
- Identified top companies leading AI/ML talent acquisition
- Clear distinction between AI-first and traditional IT hiring strategies
- Concentration of AI hiring among specific technology companies

### Statistical Validation
- Linear regression analysis reveals growth patterns
- Statistical significance tested at alpha = 0.05
- Comprehensive hypothesis testing for all research questions

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11** - Primary programming language
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization
- **Scipy** - Statistical analysis
- **BeautifulSoup** - Web scraping
- **Requests** - HTTP library for API calls
- **Jupyter** - Interactive notebook environment

## Limitations

- 13-month timeframe may not capture long-term trends
- Sample size of 4,137 jobs is representative but not comprehensive
- Data source bias toward tech-forward companies and startups
- Keyword-based categorization may have false positives/negatives
- Geographic focus primarily on US-based postings
- Public job listings only (excludes referrals and private hiring)

## Future Work

Potential areas for expansion:
- Extend data collection to 24-36 months
- Add additional data sources (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor)
- Implement ML classification using pre-trained language models
- Geographic and regional analysis
- Salary and compensation trend analysis
- Skills demand analysis by technology stack
- Industry-specific comparisons (tech vs healthcare vs finance)
