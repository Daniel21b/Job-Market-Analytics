    "## 1. Introduction & Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies has sparked significant interest in understanding how these developments are reshaping the technology job market. As AI capabilities expand, questions arise about:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Are companies increasingly hiring for AI/ML-specific roles?\n",
    "- How does AI/ML hiring compare to traditional IT hiring?\n",
    "- Which companies are leading AI/ML talent acquisition?\n",
    "- What does this trend mean for tech workforce planning?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Research Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Hypothesis:**\n",
    "> The job market for AI/ML roles is experiencing faster growth compared to traditional General IT roles, indicating a structural shift in technology workforce demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sub-Hypotheses:**\n",
    "1. AI/ML job postings show a positive month-over-month growth trend\n",
    "2. The ratio of AI/ML to General IT roles is increasing over time\n",
    "3. Certain companies disproportionately hire for AI/ML roles (>50% of tech postings)\n",
    "4. Growth trends are statistically significant and not due to random variation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the overall growth trajectory of AI/ML vs General IT job postings?\n",
    "2. When did significant divergence between AI and IT hiring trends occur (inflection points)?\n",
    "3. Which companies are driving AI/ML hiring demand?\n",
    "4. Are observed trends statistically significant?\n",
    "5. What percentage of the tech job market do AI/ML roles represent?\n"

    "## 2. Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Sources:**\n",
    "- **Hacker News \"Who is hiring?\" threads** (Oct 2023, Mar 2024, May 2024, Jul 2024, Oct 2024)\n",
    "- **Adzuna Job Search API** (2023-2024 technology job postings)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collection Method:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Web scraping for Hacker News\n",
    "from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "def scrape_hn_thread(thread_id):\n",
    "    # Fetch and parse HTML\n",
    "    # Extract job postings from comments\n",
    "    # Structure: company, role, location, description\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# API integration for Adzuna\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "def fetch_adzuna_jobs(params):\n",
    "    endpoint = \"https://api.adzuna.com/v1/api/jobs\"\n",
    "    # Query with tech-related keywords\n",
    "    # Paginate through results\n",
    "    # Checkpoint saves for reliability\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Size:**\n",
    "- Total records collected: ~8,300+\n",
    "- After cleaning: 4,137 technology job postings\n",
    "- Date range: October 2023 - October 2024 (13 months)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Data Cleaning Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Steps:**\n",
    "1. **Deduplication:** Remove duplicate postings based on company + role + location\n",
    "2. **Date standardization:** Convert various date formats to unified datetime\n",
    "3. **Missing value handling:** Drop records with missing critical fields (role, company)\n",
    "4. **Category filtering:** Focus on technology sector jobs\n",
    "5. **Text preprocessing:** Standardize company names, clean descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example cleaning workflow\n",
    "df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['company', 'role', 'location'])\n",
    "df['posting_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['posting_date'])\n",

    "df['company_clean'] = df['company'].apply(standardize_company_name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Job Categorization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Categorization Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Jobs were classified into four categories using a keyword-based scoring system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AI/ML Roles:** Machine learning engineers, data scientists, AI researchers\n",
    "2. **General IT Roles:** Software engineers, DevOps, web developers, cloud engineers\n",
    "3. **Hybrid Roles:** MLOps engineers, AI platform engineers (both AI + IT skills)\n",
    "4. **Non-Tech Roles:** Healthcare, retail, administrative positions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scoring Methodology:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def categorize_job_role(role, description):\n",
    "    # Calculate AI/ML score (0-100)\n",
    "    ai_score = calculate_ai_ml_score(role, description)\n",

    "    elif it_score >= IT_THRESHOLD:\n",
    "        return 'General IT'\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return 'Non-Tech'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keyword Sets:**\n",
    "- AI/ML: TensorFlow, PyTorch, machine learning, neural network, LLM, computer vision (60+ patterns)\n",
    "- General IT: React, Node.js, Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, microservices (70+ patterns)\n",
    "- Hybrid indicators: MLOps, AI infrastructure, model serving (7 patterns)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Time Series Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistical Methods Applied:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Regression:** Trend line fitting to determine growth slopes\n",
    "2. **Mann-Kendall Test:** Non-parametric test for monotonic trends\n",
    "3. **Pearson Correlation:** Relationship between time and job posting counts\n",
    "4. **T-Tests:** Comparing first half vs second half of time period\n",
    "5. **Growth Rate Calculations:** Month-over-month percentage changes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Framework:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Monthly aggregation\n",
    "monthly_data = df.groupby(['year_month', 'role_category']).size()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Growth rate calculation\n",

    "## 5. Limitations & Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Data Collection Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Sample Size & Duration**\n",
    "- **Limited timeframe:** 13 months (Oct 2023 - Oct 2024) may not capture long-term trends\n",
    "- **Sample size:** 4,137 tech jobs is representative but not comprehensive of entire market\n",
    "- **Seasonal effects:** Hiring patterns may vary by season (not fully captured)\n",
    "- **Recommendation:** Extend study to 24+ months for stronger trend detection\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Data Source Bias**\n",
    "- **Hacker News:** Skews toward startups and tech-forward companies\n",
    "- **Adzuna API:** May not include all job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, company sites)\n",
    "- **Geographic bias:** Primarily US-based postings\n",
    "- **Missing:** Enterprise jobs often not publicly listed\n",
    "- **Impact:** Results may over-represent certain company types or regions\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Date Accuracy**\n",
    "- **Scraping date vs posting date:** Some records use collection date not original post date\n",
    "- **Retroactive listings:** Jobs may have been posted earlier than captured\n",
    "- **Mitigation:** Used posting_date field when available, otherwise scraped_date\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Categorization Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Keyword-Based Approach**\n",
    "- **False positives:** \"Software Engineer\" at AI company ≠ AI role\n",
    "- **False negatives:** AI roles with generic titles may be miscategorized\n",
    "- **Context limitations:** Job descriptions vary in detail and clarity\n",
    "- **Alternative:** Manual labeling would be more accurate but not scalable\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Category Boundaries**\n",
    "- **Hybrid category:** Subjective threshold for mixed roles\n",
    "- **Evolving roles:** New role types (e.g., \"Prompt Engineer\") may not fit cleanly\n",
    "- **Technology overlap:** Many IT roles now involve some ML/AI tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Validation**\n",
    "- **No ground truth:** No external validation dataset available\n",
    "- **Consistency check:** Used has_ai_keywords flag for cross-validation\n",
    "- **Future work:** Expert review of random sample for accuracy assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 Statistical Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Small Sample Size Effects**\n",
    "- **Monthly counts:** Some months have <100 jobs per category\n",
    "- **Statistical power:** Limited power to detect small effects\n",
    "- **P-values:** May be inflated due to small n\n",
    "- **Confidence:** Results should be interpreted with appropriate caution\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Confounding Variables**\n",
    "- **Economic conditions:** Job market influenced by economy, not just AI trends\n",
    "- **Company lifecycle:** Startup vs established company hiring patterns differ\n",
    "- **Industry sectors:** Tech, healthcare, finance have different AI adoption rates\n",
