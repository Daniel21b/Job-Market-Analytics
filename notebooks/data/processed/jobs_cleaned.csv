We're a VC-funded startup building an automation platform for Infrastructure-as-Code, adding a Policy-as-Code layer above it, in order to make IaC usable in bigger companies, where you have to take care of state consistency, selective permissions, a usable git flow, etc.
On the backend we're using 100% Go with AWS primitives. We're looking for backend developers who like doing DevOps'y stuff sometimes (because in a way it's the spirit of our company), or have experience with the cloud native ecosystem. Ideally you'd have experience working with an IaC tool, i.e. Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, or SaltStack.
Overall we have a deeply technical product, trying to build something customers love to use, and already have a lot of happy and satisfied customers. We promise interesting work, the ability to open source parts of the project which don't give us a business advantage, as well as healthy working hours. We've also got investment days on Fridays, when you can work on anything you want, as long as it could possibly benefit Spacelift in some way.

We’re going to build great open-source standards and tooling that bring the benefits of GraphQL (types, field selection/expansion, standards) and gRPC (types, speed, versioning) to REST.
We’re ~2y old, ~10 people, have strong revenue (could choose to be profitable), and great customers (including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cloudflare). We’re backed by Sequoia.
As one of our first ten engineers, you’ll get autonomy to build great products, skilled peers, opportunity for tremendous impact, competitive salary, and a very competitive ownership stake.

Bellsong is an early stage business exploring opportunities related to therapy. This is an opportunity to join early, work alongside an experienced founder (that’s me!) and grow with the organization.
We’re motivated by a few key questions:
* Is there an alternative to the high-growth startup model that centers customers and employees rather than outside stakeholders?
* Therapy changes lives. How do we honor and promote this practice?
* Therapists are superheroes. How can we support and uplift them?
We’re looking for a generalist. Your work will span three major areas:
* Operations: you’ll keep projects organized and on-track. In a chaotic startup, you’ll be a force for order.
* Writing: from emails and blog posts, to therapist profiles—you will use language to tell stories and convince others.
* Grit: this is a role where you’ll take out the proverbial trash. You will own all of the sometimes tedious administrative work.

We practice the highest quality pediatric telemedicine, as evidenced by our exclusive hiring of board-certified pediatricians and the usage of at-home medical kits. And, we’re accessible 24 hours a day.
Our success is shown in the lives we save, the costs we save our insurers, and our exploding B2B and D2C business.
As you can imagine, pulling off affordable high-quality healthcare is a challenge. It requires a lot of engineering ingenuity, a C-suite aligned with positive patient outcomes above short-term profits, and a great product team.
We use Django, Hotwire Turbo (an HTMX-like framework), Pytorch, Sklearn, and Flutter. Experience in these technologies helps, but what’s more important is general full-stack knowledge, curiosity, and a strong work ethic.

We're redesigning the business phone network from the ground up. Starting with mobile apps and a softphone, we're losing the jargon (who cares what an IVR is?) and building features customers actually want.
We try to be flexible around work and don't believe in regular 60-hour weeks. One key aim of our product is to help employees maintain a healthy work/life balance (who wants to be disturbed by business calls on the weekends?) in an age of remote and hybrid work. The founders lead by example, with all of us having worked 4-4.5 day weeks at times in order to spend time with our children.
We're looking for full stack software engineers and/or an iOS/android software engineer - doesn't matter if you're much stronger in either the front or back end, but you do need to be able to build all the parts of a feature - there's no ""front end team"" once the backend is done. There is naturally work that's much more one sided, so you won't be stuck for months on the back end if you prefer the front end, but we're still a small startup so we expect you to get stuck in and help out where you can!
