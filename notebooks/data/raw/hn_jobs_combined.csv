But do you disagree that the media/politicians were actively working to exaggerate the impact of the disease? And really this even applied to organizations like the CDC. Read this [1] page and tell me how long you think it'd take the average person to realize they're talking about child hospitalizations
with
COVID and not child hospitalizations

COVID?
The ""summary"" of the article is that ""COVID-19 can cause severe illness in children and adolescents"" followed by numbers talking about a shocking increase in rates. The fact it's talking about people hospitalized
with
COVID is hidden in a wall of text written in language that most people wouldn't be able to decipher. That more people tested positive for a more contagious variant, in any setting, is the most unremarkable news imaginable - spun into a terrifying headline, by the CDC no less.
I see no way to imagine that article was written in good faith. And it's been the absolute norm for the past 3 years now.

We're a VC-funded startup building an automation platform for Infrastructure-as-Code, adding a Policy-as-Code layer above it, in order to make IaC usable in bigger companies, where you have to take care of state consistency, selective permissions, a usable git flow, etc.
On the backend we're using 100% Go with AWS primitives. We're looking for backend developers who like doing DevOps'y stuff sometimes (because in a way it's the spirit of our company), or have experience with the cloud native ecosystem. Ideally you'd have experience working with an IaC tool, i.e. Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, or SaltStack.
Overall we have a deeply technical product, trying to build something customers love to use, and already have a lot of happy and satisfied customers. We promise interesting work, the ability to open source parts of the project which don't give us a business advantage, as well as healthy working hours. We've also got investment days on Fridays, when you can work on anything you want, as long as it could possibly benefit Spacelift in some way.

At Juniper, we’ve built an end-to-end billing system. We’ve built something really good, something that clinicians really need and love. We automate and abstract the tedious, manual, repetitive work that goes into the administrative duties of running a clinic, so that clinicians can do what they do best — providing high quality care. It starts with ingesting clinic data, and then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country. If claims need corrections or appeals, most of the time we can handle those automatically or our CX and Operations team use our in-house internal tools. We also handle patient invoicing for co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles (we never send anything to collections).
We are a team of 27 with strong product market fit — in Q4 last year we’ve had to push out onboarding because engineering can’t build quickly enough, something we’ve scaled out of and will hopefully not bottleneck growth again.

Hi, I’m one of the founders of Nooks — we’re trying to re-invent how sales teams work with real-time collaboration and AI.
Nooks is: - A virtual office: you can work from anywhere in the world, but still work with your team and get feedback and coaching like you’re sitting side-by-side. - and an AI co-pilot. We learn how your team works, identify “winning” strategies behaviors, then share them with the whole team during and after calls!
We’re working on fun engineering challenges including complex distributed systems, low-latency algorithms & infrastructure, and modeling sales calls with large language models. You'll also have the chance to make a huge impact on our customers (sales reps who spend 80% of their work day on Nooks.)
Right now we’re a relatively small team (~40 ppl) growing super quickly - doubling revenue every quarter, and recently hit $3.5M ARR!
Looking for experienced engineers who love tackling difficult product questions and working closely with customers. Excitement about language models, few-shot learning and other recent AI advances is also a plus :)

In the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that’s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.
Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.
How can this be, and how can we change it?
Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.
Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.
But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deli",True,True,"US, we","$12,500",True,True,3376,2024-05,40224213,2025-10-24

We are also known that we hire slow, especially since we look for a unique blend of multiple tech such as Rust, Go, Elixir (not necessarily exactly all in one), that caused some of the more suspicious members to think we are a recruiting agency looking for American talent to bring them to Europe.

Another observation they will often do to derive certain assumptions that do not match the established way of ""silicon valley"" prescription is they will go on Linkedin to check for everyone who works for the company without knowing that there also exist people who don't really take Linkedin seriously, and don't have the need to update it in the first day they start working at Google.

You’d be hard pressed to work here and NOT learn something new about startups every day – which might be helpful if you’re interested in starting a company yourself.

Today, YC offers so many software tools to help founders build their companies, including:

Work at a Startup, where 1000s of companies have hired from a pool of 1M+ job seekers

Chorus One operates validators on many proof-of-stake blockchains (the ones where security is based on a Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm rather than wasting energy). We are hiring for several roles, but the one I will highlight is what we call the Platforms Engineer. Some companies call this Site Reliability Engineering or Devops.
The main thing we do is take upstream software, build it, run it on our infrastructure, and then monitor it and optimize that setup. Some things that make this interesting are:
* Building automation that enables us to do this for many networks (60+ currently).
    * Doing this with high uptime, building automation for failover, etc.
    * Working with software that is on the one hand cutting-edge and doing interesting things (consensus algorithms, distributed systems, cryptography), but on the other hand that means it’s immature and often not easy to operate and monitor. Often we have to build custom tools, and dive into the source code of the project. We contribute patches upstream when it makes sense.
    * Some of these projects are exercising the limits of what a machine can do, we have to do some low-level investigation that requires understanding of what the Linux kernel and network hardware are doing to properly identify what’s going on.

I am starting a research lab funded by a hedge fund that I created 5 years ago. The hedge is doing well, and applies ML to quant finance. The research and trading activities should reinforce each other over time: the research publishes research and fosters in-house ML expertise. The trading applies ML to quant finance and brings funding. The research entity is incorporated, funded, has an office and 0 employees currently.
My vision for the research lab is the following:
- A bunch of phds in a room: create a good working environment, optimize for research output & runway.
  - Take the ""bitter lesson"" seriously: most of the successes in modern machine learning are due to deep learning and the ability to leverage vasts amounts of compute and data.
I want to study how DL/LLM models reason, using ARC as a benchmark (

,
https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547

With that in mind, today I'm looking for the following role:

Technologically, the frontend is TypeScript & React. Our frontend is a major differentiator - our users tend to be less tech-inclined, so ease of use is a business imperative. We also have a service-worker powered offline web app and plan to build another in short order.
