We’re creating robots that autonomously construct buildings. We design all of our hardware and software in-house in central Amsterdam, and we’re starting with autonomous bricklaying robots.
We have built a machine vision pipeline that can achieve sub-millimetre localisation on construction sites, and a neat software stack that lets us configure and control robots with ease. We’re deploying our robots on real construction sites and have started making the first revenue from our bricklaying-as-a-service model.
The software team is now nine people (~35 people overall), and continuing to grow. There’s strong customer demand for what we’re building, and we’re starting to scale up robot production to meet it.
Our stack is mostly: Rust, TypeScript, Python, NixOS.

Unlike earlier HN Who's Hiring posts, we have specific existing clients in mind: total comp is not flexible hourly, but full-time salary with client-tied equity compensation.  We are currently filling “Tier 3” (5-10 y/o/e, $240K-$320K annual comp) and ""Tier 4"" (7-20 y/o/e, $300K-$370K annual total comp) roles:
Engineers: Full stack polyglot but JS/TS heavy (SQL/NextJS/Node/React/Remix), AWS deployments.  

    Infra+Devops: Kubernetes/Docker, Terraform, AWS service set, common CI/CD options.

    PMs: JIRA/Trello, stakeholder wrangling, proof of winning engineer trust and surviving big-org politics.
We’re a worker-first operation.  Applicants must meet a high bar; in return, I pledge my personal commitment to finding you interesting work and getting you good pay.

We are hiring for several roles, but the one I will highlight is what we call the Platforms Engineer. Some companies call this Site Reliability Engineering or Devops.
The main thing we do is take upstream software, build it, run it on our infrastructure, and then monitor it and optimize that setup. Some things that make this interesting are:
* Building automation that enables us to do this for many networks (60+ currently).
    * Doing this with high uptime, building automation for failover, etc.
    * Working with software that is on the one hand cutting-edge and doing interesting things (consensus algorithms, distributed systems, cryptography), but on the other hand that means it’s immature and often not easy to operate and monitor. Often we have to build custom tools, and dive into the source code of the project. We contribute patches upstream when it makes sense.
    * Some of these projects are exercising the limits of what a machine can do, we have to do some low-level investigation that requires understanding of what the Linux kernel and network hardware are doing to properly identify what’s going on.

https://permitflow.com
PermitFlow’s mission is to streamline and simplify construction permitting in the $1.6 trillion United States construction market. Our software reduces time to permit, supporting permitting end-to-end including permit research, application preparation, submission, and monitoring.
We’ve raised a $31m Series A led by Kleiner Perkins with participation from Initialized Capital, Y Combinator, Felicis Ventures, Altos Ventures, and the founders and executives from Zillow, PlanGrid, Thumbtack, Bluebeam, Uber, Procore, and more.
Permitting is a challenging yet interesting problem; thousands of municipalities across the United States have their own processes and requirements - many which are continually updating. Software, AI, and LLMs provide an exciting opportunity for us to reason at scale and distill a nuanced and localized permitting process into a standard and streamlined experience for our customers.
We're looking for customer-obsessed, ambitious, and hard-working teammates who are excited about solving a real-world problem with technology at its helm.
