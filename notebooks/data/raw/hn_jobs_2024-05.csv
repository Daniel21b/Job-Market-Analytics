Continua was founded in April 2023 by a Distinguished Engineer from Google Research to give everyone in the world an agent that uses their real-time context and personal memory to deliver actionable and timely assistance.
Our MVP is currently in limited alpha testing, and we’re immensely excited by the feedback we’re getting from early users - they’re finding that the Continua agent helps them in all manner of surprisingly useful ways.
This is an opportunity to be a part of setting the product and technical direction of this early stage company! ML engineers at Continua work on new approaches for knowledge representation, multimodality, and personalization under computational resource constraints. Systems engineers at Continua work on a wide variety of secure and reliable backend services and data pipelines to power our products.
We’re backed by tier-1 VCs, and we’ve already assembled a team of seven engineers with backgrounds at Google, Slack, CourseHero, Stash, and Amazon. We have a limited number of additional spots available on the team for engineers who are excited about building innovative products that leverage the latest advances in ML, including Transformers / Mamba, RLHF, LoRA/QLoRA, at-edge (on-device) training and inference, privacy-first ML, and more.

At Juniper, we’ve built an end-to-end billing system. We’ve built something really good, something that clinicians really need and love. We automate and abstract the tedious, manual, repetitive work that goes into the administrative duties of running a clinic, so that clinicians can do what they do best — providing high quality care. It starts with ingesting clinic data, and then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country. If claims need corrections or appeals, most of the time we can handle those automatically or our CX and Operations team use our in-house internal tools. We also handle patient invoicing for co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles (we never send anything to collections).
We are a team of 27 with strong product market fit — in Q4 last year we’ve had to push out onboarding because engineering can’t build quickly enough, something we’ve scaled out of and will hopefully not bottleneck growth again.

Hi, I’m one of the founders of Nooks — we’re trying to re-invent how sales teams work with real-time collaboration and AI.
Nooks is: - A virtual office: you can work from anywhere in the world, but still work with your team and get feedback and coaching like you’re sitting side-by-side. - and an AI co-pilot. We learn how your team works, identify “winning” strategies behaviors, then share them with the whole team during and after calls!
We’re working on fun engineering challenges including complex distributed systems, low-latency algorithms & infrastructure, and modeling sales calls with large language models. You'll also have the chance to make a huge impact on our customers (sales reps who spend 80% of their work day on Nooks.)
Right now we’re a relatively small team (~40 ppl) growing super quickly - doubling revenue every quarter, and recently hit $3.5M ARR!
Looking for experienced engineers who love tackling difficult product questions and working closely with customers. Excitement about language models, few-shot learning and other recent AI advances is also a plus :)

In the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that’s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.
Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.
How can this be, and how can we change it?
Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.
Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.
But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deli",True,True,"US, we","$12,500",True,True,3376,2024-05,40224213,2025-10-24

TileDB has recently announced a $34 million Series B fund-raise and is actively hiring for engineers across a range of roles (SRE, backend/distributed systems, database internals, and more). You will have the opportunity to work on innovative technology that creates impact for challenging problems in genomics, geospatial, machine learning, distributed systems, and many other areas.
TileDB Cloud is the modern database, allowing developers and scientists to capture, analyze, and share any data with any tool. We build on a broad foundation of open source, maintaining the TileDB storage engine, libraries for genomics (single-cell and population), geospatial (raster, point clouds, and more), a TileDB visualization engine extending Babylon.js, and much more ([github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB](
http://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB
))
With TileDB, all data — tables, genomics, images, videos, location, time-series — is captured as multi-dimensional arrays. To supercharge this data, TileDB Cloud implements a serverless infrastructure delivering query execution, access control, data and code sharing, and distributed computing at global scale — eliminating cluster management, minimizing TCO, and promoting scientific collaboration and reproducibility.

We are the company famous for ""requesting"" a desktop screenshot when applying for a job, which earned us a lot of attention and criticism, even though the input field for the unimaginable sinful experiment was never a required one.
We are also known that we hire slow, especially since we look for a unique blend of multiple tech such as Rust, Go, Elixir (not necessarily exactly all in one), that caused some of the more suspicious members to think we are a recruiting agency looking for American talent to bring them to Europe. Which of course is not the case, and we deeply apologize to anyone who might find such slow and broad hiring offensive.
Another observation they will often do to derive certain assumptions that do not match the established way of ""silicon valley"" prescription is they will go on Linkedin to check for everyone who works for the company without knowing that there also exist people who don't really take Linkedin seriously, and don't have the need to update it in the first day they start working at Google.
Nevertheless, we appreciate the readers who undertake the efforts here and appreciate when people do something ""outside of the established book of prescription"", so we would like to preserve this culture in our humble organization.

Why would you want to work at YC? Well, the short of it is that you’d get unprecedented insight into how companies are started – with access to all the talks, constantly being around founders, and working directly with YC Group Partners. Our GPs are possibly the 12 most knowledgeable people in the world about starting companies. You’d be hard pressed to work here and NOT learn something new about startups every day – which might be helpful if you’re interested in starting a company yourself.
Software also touches everything YC does. When I went through YC in 2013, the core pieces of the YC batch were a dinner each week, a 1-1 with your group partner, and an end-of-batch Demo Day event to raise money. Today, YC offers so many software tools to help founders build their companies, including:
Demo Day website, which has helped founders raise $3B+ over the last 3 years
Work at a Startup, where 1000s of companies have hired from a pool of 1M+ job seekers
Bookface, a tool for YC founders to support and help each other build their companies
YC software runs kind of like a startup: we have a small engineering team (15 people) full of full-stack software developers (Rails, React, Postgres) who talk to our users, ship fast and iterate often.
